# Application with examples of various state management techniques.



## Getting Started

Run next commands in root of project from terminal without quotes:
1. "flutter pub get" 
2. "flutter packages pub run build_runner build" or, if you have conflicts "flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs"

If you do not receive an error message, everything is fine and you can run the application on an emulator or a real device.
